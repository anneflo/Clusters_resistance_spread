Briefly, we perform stochastic simulations of the branching process modeling the propagation in a host population of a novel bacterial strain that can acquire resistance. The within-host growth can be treated either deterministically or stochastically (here, one folder corresponds to the deterministic case, and the other to the stochastic case). We consider "generations" of hosts, the first one corresponding to the first infected host, the second one to the hosts directly infected by this first host, etc.

In order to use the code, please run either "Generate_data_two_types_det" in the folder "2_types_det" or "Generate_data_two_types_stoch" in the folder "2_types_stoch" under Matlab.
